# Senario: 
conversion is a type of lower funnel objective in terms of funnel
analysis. As we perform analysis on advertising or user data, one key metric is
conversion, which can be interpreted as conversion from user to advertiser or
conversion from upper funnel spend to lower funnel spend. Usually, the goal
would be either to understand the conversion rate across different
user/advertiser segments and provide further granularity to enrich the dataset
or to predict the conversion rate based on the behaviour or characteristic data. 

# Tech Stack:
descriptive analysis (python pandas), random forest (python sklearn)

# This practice answers the following questions:

1, what is the user profile?
2, what is the association between conversion rate and the user profile?
3, what are some key indicators for a high/low conversion rate?
4, what would a group of users with a high conversion rate look like?
5, If we wanna run a marketing campaign, what do think could be the target
audience?
6, How do you predict the conversion rate? What model do you wanna use?
Implement it
7, After completing your model, think about what would be the next after having
the prediction? Eg. how to improve conversion rate based on the prediction?
